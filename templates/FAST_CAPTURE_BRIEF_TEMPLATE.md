# FAST-CAPTURE BRIEF TEMPLATE

Use this when you've created something spontaneously (jam, sound design accident, sample discovery) and want to capture it before the creative momentum fades. The Shadow Creator fills this in with you during fast-capture mode.

---

## FAST-CAPTURE BRIEF

**Date:** [Date]
**Capture Source:** [Push 3 jam / synth exploration / sample discovery / spontaneous idea / loop from another context]
**Time Spent Capturing:** [Target: under 5 minutes]

### The Spark

[1-2 sentences. What happened and why it's worth keeping.]

Example: "Was messing with Serum's FM oscillator and accidentally created a bass tone that sounds like a mechanical heartbeat. Dark, rhythmic, pulsing — immediately felt like a Horror section anchor."

### What It Sounds Like (Subjective)

[Describe in feelings, images, metaphors — not technical terms. This feeds the narrative.]

Example: "Sounds like a machine breathing in a dark factory. Relentless but not chaotic — there's a mechanical precision to it. Feels like the moment before you realize something is wrong."

### Musical DNA Extracted

- **Rhythmic pattern:** [straight 16ths / syncopated / swing / triplet / other — describe the groove]
- **Melodic contour:** [ascending / descending / arch / static / evolving / N/A if percussive]
- **Pitch content:** [single note / riff (describe intervals) / chord / atonal]
- **Implied key/mode:** [best guess, or "ambiguous"]
- **Implied BPM range:** [if rhythmic, otherwise "tempo-flexible"]
- **Energy level:** [0-100%, where 0 = ambient silence, 100 = peak drop]
- **Timbral character:** [dark/bright, clean/distorted, warm/cold, smooth/gritty, wide/narrow]
- **Duration of captured idea:** [how long is the loop/riff/phrase — bars or seconds]

### Where It Lives on the Emotional Spectrum

```
[Peace]---[Horror]---[Chaos]---[Numbness]---[Anger]---[Hope]---[Triumph]
              ^
         LIVES HERE
```

[1 sentence explaining why it fits there]

### Narrative Fit

- **Could belong to:** [existing track name / "new track" / "could go anywhere"]
- **Suggested section type:** [intro / buildup / drop / breakdown / transition / climax / outro]
- **Emotional role:** [What moment in a story does this represent?]

### Development Paths

[Quick brainstorm — what could this become?]

**Path A:** [e.g., "Build a full Horror intro around this bass tone. Add sparse hi-hats and a reversed pad."]

**Path B:** [e.g., "Use this as a transition element — the mechanical heartbeat that signals the shift from Peace to Horror."]

**Path C:** [e.g., "Layer this with a clean sub underneath for a bass layer in a full drop section."]

### Technical Capture

[Whatever technical info you have — this doesn't need to be complete]

- **Synth/instrument:** [e.g., "Serum — Osc A: FM from B, saw carrier, sine modulator"]
- **Key parameters:** [e.g., "FM depth at 40%, filter cutoff 650Hz, LFO1 on cutoff at 1/4 rate"]
- **Preset saved as:** [filename if saved]
- **MIDI captured?** [Yes — in clip X on track Y / No — played live, need to recreate]
- **Audio bounced?** [Yes — filename / No]

### Next Step

- [ ] Develop further in this session (fast-capture → production mode)
- [ ] Save and return to later (add to ideas backlog)
- [ ] Integrate into existing track: [track name]
- [ ] Needs a full narrative brief before development

### Ideas Backlog Reference

[If saving for later, give it a short memorable tag]

**Tag:** [e.g., "mechanical-heartbeat-bass"]
**Priority:** [High — this could be a track centerpiece / Medium — useful element / Low — interesting texture to file away]

## Example: Filled Fast-Capture Brief

**Date:** 2026-02-13
**Capture Source:** Serum exploration while warming up
**Time Spent Capturing:** 3 minutes

### The Spark

Was tweaking FM depth on a bass preset and accidentally hit a sweet spot around 42% that created this pulsing, mechanical texture. Sounded less like music and more like industrial machinery. Immediately thought "this is the sound of the Iron Dome missiles launching."

### What It Sounds Like (Subjective)

Sounds like a machine breathing in a dark factory. Relentless but not chaotic — there's a mechanical precision to it. Feels like the moment before you realize something is wrong. Low-end throb with a metallic edge, almost submarine sonar pings but darker.

### Musical DNA Extracted

- **Rhythmic pattern:** Straight 16ths, locked to grid, no swing — robotic precision
- **Melodic contour:** Static single note (D1), occasional octave jump creates tension
- **Pitch content:** Single note bass with FM harmonics adding upper partials
- **Implied key/mode:** D minor (Dm) or could work in any minor key
- **Implied BPM range:** 145-150 BPM (tested at 148, felt perfect)
- **Energy level:** 75% — not peak drop energy but definitely aggressive/driving
- **Timbral character:** Dark, metallic, cold, distorted mid-range, sub-heavy, narrow stereo
- **Duration of captured idea:** 4-bar loop

### Where It Lives on the Emotional Spectrum

```
[Peace]---[Horror]---[Chaos]---[Numbness]---[Anger]---[Hope]---[Triumph]
              ^
         LIVES HERE
```

This sits squarely in Horror — it's the mechanical terror, the industrial war machine, the moment of realization. Not chaotic (that would be less controlled), not numb (too aggressive). This is active, present horror.

### Narrative Fit

- **Could belong to:** New track OR existing "War of the Worlds" sketch
- **Suggested section type:** Intro OR first drop (Horror phase)
- **Emotional role:** The sound of the threat approaching. The Iron Dome activating. Mechanical response to human terror.

### Development Paths

**Path A:** Build a full Horror intro around this bass tone. Add sparse hi-hats (tight 16ths, low velocity), reversed pad swell (building dread), single kick on 1 of every 4 bars (mechanical heartbeat). 32 bars before anything else enters. Let the bass be the only melody.

**Path B:** Use this as the bass for the first drop (bars 49-64). Layer it with clean sub underneath (-12dB, sine wave, just root note). Add Nitzhonot rolling arp on top for contrast (the human response to the machine). Create tension between mechanical bass and organic arp.

**Path C:** Transition element — this bass enters at bar 32 during buildup, signaling the shift from Peace to Horror. Starts alone, then kick joins, then rest of arrangement. The bass is the warning siren.

### Technical Capture

- **Synth/instrument:** Serum
  - Osc A: Saw wave (carrier)
  - Osc B: Sine wave (modulator)
  - FM from B → A: 42% depth (the sweet spot)
  - Detune: +7 cents on Osc A for slight width
- **Key parameters:**
  - Filter: LP 24dB @ 650Hz, resonance 0.35
  - Distortion: Tube saturation, drive 40%
  - Sub: -6dB sine wave layer (Serum sub osc)
  - No reverb, minimal delay (8th note, 15% mix, feedback 20%)
- **Preset saved as:** `FC_MechanicalHeartbeat_Bass_v1.fxp`
- **MIDI captured?** Yes — 4-bar loop in Ableton clip, Track 3 "Bass Test"
- **Audio bounced?** Yes — `mechanical-bass-148bpm-Dm.wav`

### Next Step

- [x] Develop further in this session (fast-capture → production mode)
- [ ] Save and return to later (add to ideas backlog)
- [ ] Integrate into existing track: War of the Worlds
- [ ] Needs a full narrative brief before development

**Decision:** Building this into a new track RIGHT NOW. Calling it "Iron Dome" (working title). This bass IS the concept.

### Ideas Backlog Reference

**Tag:** `mechanical-heartbeat-bass`
**Priority:** High — this could be a track centerpiece (and it became one)
