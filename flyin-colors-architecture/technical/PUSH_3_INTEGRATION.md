# Push 3 Integration Workflow — Flyin' Colors

**Hardware:** Ableton Push 3
**Key Features:** Standalone mode, integrated Ableton control, polyphonic sequencer, hands-on parameter control

---

## Push 3 Capabilities

### 1. Standalone Mode
- Push 3 can run without a computer
- Built-in synths and drum machines
- Use for: Sketching ideas on the go, live performance without laptop

**Flyin' Colors Use:**
- Sketch bass patterns and melodies in standalone mode
- Export MIDI to computer for full production
- Live performance mode (trigger scenes, control parameters)

### 2. Integrated Ableton Control
- Deep integration with Ableton Live
- Parameter control via encoders
- Step sequencer and note mode
- Session and arrangement view control

**Flyin' Colors Use:**
- Hands-on MIDI recording (stay away from mouse)
- Real-time parameter tweaking (filter cutoff, resonance)
- Scene triggering for arrangement

### 3. Polyphonic Step Sequencer
- Create complex MIDI patterns
- Velocity, probability, note length per step
- Integrated with Ableton clips

**Flyin' Colors Use:**
- Program basslines (rolling 16ths, velocity accents)
- Create drum patterns (four-on-floor, fills)
- Design arp sequences

## Workflow Integration

### Mode 1: Hands-On MIDI Recording

**Workflow:**
1. Load synth on track (e.g., Serum on Bass track)
2. Enter Note Mode on Push 3
3. Play/record bassline in real-time
4. Use velocity pads for expressive dynamics
5. Quantize in Ableton if needed

**Benefits:** More musical, less grid-based than mouse input

### Mode 2: Step Sequencing

**Workflow:**
1. Enter Step Sequencer mode on Push 3
2. Program 16th-note bass pattern
3. Adjust velocity per step (accent pattern)
4. Set note length for legato/staccato
5. Loop and refine

**Benefits:** Precise control, perfect for repetitive patterns (bass, arps)

### Mode 3: Parameter Automation

**Workflow:**
1. Select track with loaded synth
2. Turn encoder to control filter cutoff, resonance, etc.
3. Record parameter movement as automation
4. Use Push 3's touchstrip for dramatic sweeps

**Benefits:** Tactile, expressive automation (feels more natural than mouse drawing)

### Mode 4: Scene Launching (Live Performance)

**Workflow:**
1. Organize clips into scenes (Intro, Buildup, Drop, etc.)
2. Use Push 3 pads to trigger scenes
3. Control crossfader/volume on the fly
4. Mute/unmute tracks with dedicated buttons

**Benefits:** Live arrangement control, spontaneous creative decisions

## MCP Server + Push 3

**Hybrid workflow:**
- MCP server generates MIDI and places it in Ableton
- Push 3 used for real-time tweaking and performance

**Example:**
1. Shadow Creator → MIDI Producer generates bassline via MCP
2. MIDI placed in Ableton on Bass track
3. Avi uses Push 3 to tweak velocity, adjust filter cutoff
4. Final pattern saved

## Push 3 Mapping for Flyin' Colors

### Custom User Mode

Push 3 allows custom MIDI mappings. Map key parameters for quick access:

**Encoders:**
1. Bass Filter Cutoff
2. Bass Resonance
3. Lead Reverb Send
4. Pad Reverb Send
5. Master Volume
6. FX Riser Volume
7. Arp Rate
8. [Free]

**Touchstrip:**
- Pitch bend for leads
- Filter sweep control (mapped to multiple tracks)

---

## Standalone Mode for Sketching

**Use case:** Avi has an idea away from the studio

**Workflow:**
1. Power on Push 3 (standalone mode)
2. Load built-in synth
3. Record bassline or melody idea
4. Save as MIDI file on Push 3
5. Export to computer when back in studio
6. Import into Ableton project, assign to proper synth

**Benefits:** Never lose inspiration, sketch anywhere

---

## Integration with Agent Workflow

**When MIDI Producer generates patterns:**
- Patterns are placed in Ableton
- Avi can immediately tweak them on Push 3 without touching mouse
- Real-time feel, faster iteration

**When Automation Engineer creates automation:**
- Automation curves placed in Ableton
- Avi can override/adjust with Push 3 encoders for more natural feel

---

## Key Principles

1. **Hands-on workflow** — Push 3 keeps Avi away from the mouse, more musical
2. **Hybrid automation** — MCP generates, Push 3 refines
3. **Standalone for ideas** — Capture inspiration anywhere
4. **Live performance ready** — Scene launching for spontaneous arrangement
5. **Tactile expression** — Velocity, parameter movement, real-time control

---

**Next Steps:**
- Map key parameters in Ableton for Push 3 User Mode
- Test MIDI recording workflow
- Integrate with MCP server output (MCP generates, Push refines)
